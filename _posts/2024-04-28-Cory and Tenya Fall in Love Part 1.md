## Cory and Tenya Fall in Love (Part 1)

After several long months of talking and becoming friends online through Facebook Dating, I invited Tenya to come to the US to do some shopping and enjoy some fine dining here with me in Tucson.

We hadn't met in person prior to this and it was a big move in our friendship leading up to the start of our relationship. 

Tenya took a bus ride from her home town of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico up to Tucson, AZ, USA to visit me. During her trip to the US we both couldn't wait to finally meet each other. We had so much in common but yet had just started chatting several weeks prior getting to know each other. 

It was obvious that we would be together and enjoy each others company before her arrival. We just didn't know that when we hugged each other in that bus station it was the start of something incredible, an unforgettable experience many couples do not have the opportunity to discover. 

From the bus station we quickly made our way back to the mi casa, to take a nap bc Tenya had decided to travel over night, 12:00 AM to 5:30 AM Travel time. We both needed some relaxation before our big journey to discover each other and explore Tucson. Side note: I moved to Tucson just a few months prior to her arrival so we were both new to this area exploring together. 

After our nap we began to chat briefly about what English she knew and what Spanish I could speak. 

We quickly found that I knew only how to say hello, (Hola) and not else. I was however prepared to translate with AI and other apps and learn as we went which we did little of only when we needed deep translation and we couldn't understand each other. 

I had been learning the basics of Spanish before she arrived but communicating in Spanish was hard at first but luckily this didn't stop us from falling in love naturally. 

Tenya knew enough English to chat with me and communicate enough that we knew our partnership in this newly found love journey was going to be forever. 

After our afternoon of chatting, napping and getting to know each other we journeyed to Costco our first exploration together. Funny enough I was so focused on just being with her I forgot my wallet and we had to go back and fourth to retrieve it. 

We stocked up on supplies for the weekend and I bought extra of my favorite Costco water, high in alkalinity. 

After we unloaded the supplies we decided to head out to diner at Anthony's Diner. We took a ton of photo's with the old school style outdoor theme that is so famous for this restaurant. It's a real blast from the past and very American style dining with history behind it. 

Anthony's has a play/show every weekend nights but we decided to just enjoy each other with a Moscow Mule, A Margarita, A Crispy Chicken Salad that could feed a Family of 3. and lastly my Gluten-Free Bacon Cheeseburger. (I'm Celiac so GF is going to come up often.) Also just to mention I'm writing this blog post several weeks after Tenya and I met so the items on menu are fuzzy in my mind and future blog posts will have the exact food items if I remember to note them down, lol.

We didn't get any food pics at this restaurant but we did get a great shot of us enjoying a margarita together.

After Diner we made it back home just in time to see one of the most beautiful sunsets I have witnessed in awhile, right from my front porch.

She is the most amazing and gorgeous woman in the universe this was our first night together.

After this we just enjoyed each other's company telling stories listening to Mexican style music and laughing with all the joy in our hearts. What a perfect first day to coming weekend of our exploration into each others hearts.
